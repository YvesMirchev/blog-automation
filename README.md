# Blog Automation Repository

This repository was created to explore various DevOps tools and techniques. The repository includes artifacts developed during this exploration. As part of this exercise, we delve into:

- **Terraform:** Utilized for defining infrastructure components.
- **Ansible:** Employed for configuration management purposes.
- **Bash Scripts:** Incorporated for artifact creation and deployment where no CI/CD mechanisms are currently in place.

## Application

The automation aims to manage a Java application hosted in [this repository](https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project/tree/aws-LiftAndShift) under the branch aws-LiftAndShift. Detailed information about the application can be found there. It's essential to clarify that I do not own any rights to this application, have not contributed to its development, and do not commercialize this project in any manner. The public availability of the original repository led to its inclusion in this exercise. Future plans involve replacing this application with a personal one.

## Project Status
